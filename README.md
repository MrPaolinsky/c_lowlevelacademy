# Tools for C
gcc build-essential 
(C Development Tools and Libraries group on fedora, or group install c-development and development-tools)

## Valgrind

Valgrind is a tool that will run my program while monitoring it to cound calls to malloc and free. And will make a leaked memory report at the end.

## DB project
As part of the course I am taking here there is a project I have to build. A simple file based data base, the course requires to have said project on its own repository, so some tests can be done automatically on my code. The repository for this project can be found at my github with the name "file_db_lowlevel_course".
