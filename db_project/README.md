# Expectations 

- I am expected to write everything myself using C 
- I can use any standard library function taught during this course 
- I have to do clean readable code with comments explaining parts 
- I will have some starters for structs and helper functions 

# My design 

- For now I think I only need a module or a system library to read and write files.
- Maybe some encryption OS utils might be usefull?
